# Basic-C-Game
## Description

I developed this game as a part of my winter project in class 11th. In this game the user controls his car (green) with the left and right arrow keys and has to dodge the obstacles (opponent cars in blue) which are descending randomly (in two columns) on the screen. This game has several levels and with the increase in each level the speed of the game increases until there is a winner!

## Challeneges I faced
* The biggest challenge was to give a grapical display without using __*Graphics.h*__ library. So I overcame this problem by using the ASCII values then used them creatively to give the shape of a car and the background as the road.
* The second was to switch between the continuous operation :-
  1. The movement of the obstacles
  2. The switch between the left and right position on te user end
* so I overcame this by using if-else contruct and kbhit() function which allowed the user to switch quickly without counting the __key press (even for long time)__ as several inputs.

## Getting Started

Just download the *.CPP file* and you can compile and run the code on __TurboC++ or TurboC__
